# Redux practice

## 💻 Project

The objective of this project was to learn and practice Redux. It is a simple app that displays users; you may add new users, change the username, and/or delete a user. <br /> <br />
The app component read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state; <br />
a <Provider /> component makes the Redux store available to the rest of the app; <br />
**useSelector** reads a value from the store state and subscribes to updates, while **useDispatch** returns the store's dispatch method to let you dispatch actions.
